Functions explanation:

Route link extension to be called: ...api/<Route>
<Route> is specified for example as '...Route = "custom/{_id:<constraint>}/{_name?}")], ..., int _id, string _name'
Thus being called as  ...api/custom/9/Vince
                      ...api/custom/9
                      ...api/custom
Precedant variables are required to access the latter ones even when both are optional
Adding a '?' applies that it is a pseudo-optional variable: 'pseudo' due to the precedant rule
Multiple constraints can be applied to a parameter by adding a ':' after the variable name as a seperator for each constraint
A list of constraint options can be found at:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-api/overview/web-api-routing-and-actions/attribute-routing-in-web-api-2#route-constraints
Every parameter must be defined after the HTTPTrigger attribute, parameter names must be exact as in the attribute.
